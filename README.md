# CarTraker-AndroidApp

> Car Traker is an Android application designed to help users remember and find their parked car.
The app allows users to save the location of a parked vehicle, optionally adding a photo and a note. Users can later locate their car with one tap, which redirects them to Google Maps for navigation. The application also stores a history of previous parking locations, enabling users to review past entries.
